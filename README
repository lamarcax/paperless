1. INTRODUCTION

"EDMS" is an abbreviation for 
"Extended Document Management System" -  
EDMS is a pure webapplication written in PHP, so to use it you need a 
webserver, that supports PHP4 and a MySQL database server.

Recommended Configuration:
- Apache 1.3 or higher (www.apache.org)
- PHP 4.3.1 or higher (www.php.net)
- MySQL 11.11 or higher (www.mysql.org)
- GNU unzip/zip version installed
EDMS is released under the General Public Licence (GPL) - see LICENCE.TXT.

=============================================================================
2. INSTALLING AND RUNNING EDMS 

Simple (if the webserver, php and mysql are running already).

!!! PLEASE NOTE THAT PHP NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH --mime-magic enabled !!!

a) extract the package edms-1.0.tgz  in your chosen webdirectory 
   (e.g. /var/www/html/edms/ )

b) create a mysql database for edms (mysql: 'create database edms'). You dont 
   have to call it 'edms' - but it would simplify the configuration work.

c) in /dbscript you should find a file named edms.sql - run it and all needed
   tables will be created ('cat edms.sql | mysql edms').
   The SQL-File will create the user 'admin' with default-password 'admin'
   (CHANGE IT!) - !!! 

d) edit the configuration-file /config.inc.php:
	$cfg["site_name"]		The name of your site.
	$cfg["version"]			The version of EDMS 
	$cfg["help_link"]		The IMAGE or string that is displayed
					as the online help link
	$cfg["email_link"]		The IMAGE or string that is displayed 
					as the MAIL TO link.
	$cfg["server"]			The hostname or IP address of your
					MySQL server
	$cfg["user"]			The MySQL database user
	$cfg["pass"]			The MySQL database password
	$cfg["db"]			The MySQL database name
	$cfg["basepath"]		The location on the file system where
					EDMS has been installed

	
	EDMS supports full text indexing of documents by using conversion
	plug-ins. In the default configuration file conversion plug-ins have
	been defined for TXT , HTML , PDF and WORD documents. Since you will
	need third party GNU tools to make this work those plug-in lines have been
	commented out by default.Before you enable a specific plug-in, please
	make sure the conversion program is available on your system and the webserver
	user has execution permission on the tool.

	The WORD indexing plug-in uses antiword which can be obtained from:

	http://www.winfield.demon.nl/

	The PDF indexing plug-in uses pdftotext which is part of the XPDF
	package. The XPDF package can be obtained as an RPM/DEB file from your
	Linux vendor or can be downloaded from:

	http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/
 
	The HTML indexing plug-in uses Html2Text which can be obtained from:

	
	http://linux.tucows.com/internet/preview/170445.html 

	
	These third party utilities are also available on the EDMS website.


	The standard magic.mime file which comes with an installation of PHP
	4.3 contains a limited type of mime-definitions. To have all documents
	categorised under their correct mime type you should replace/merge the
	magic.mime file with the EDMS supplied magic.mime file which can be
	found in the /ext directory of the EDMS archive.

	All other configuration options are self explanatory and can be left to the
   	defaults. For more information about the configuration directives ,
	please refer to the MANUAL which can be found on http://edms.anubex.com	

	
	
Thats it.
